In the context of **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, identifying **Domain Entities** and **Value Objects** for **IPFS** involves understanding the core concepts and abstractions of the system. Here's a breakdown:

* * * * *

### **Domain Entities**

**Entities** are objects with a unique identity that persists over time. In IPFS, entities often represent real-world or logical objects that change and are central to the system.

1.  **File (Content)**

    -   Represents a file or content stored in the IPFS network.
    -   Attributes:
        -   Unique Identifier (Content Identifier - CID)
        -   Size
        -   Type (e.g., text, image, video)
        -   Metadata (e.g., owner, creation date)
    -   Behavior:
        -   Can be added, retrieved, and pinned.

2.  **Node**

    -   Represents a participant in the IPFS network (a peer).
    -   Attributes:
        -   Node ID
        -   Peer Address (IP or multiaddress)
        -   Storage Capacity
        -   Connected Peers
    -   Behavior:
        -   Can host files, relay content, and respond to queries.

3.  **Pin**

    -   Represents a decision to retain a file on a node permanently.
    -   Attributes:
        -   Pinned CID
        -   Pin Type (recursive, direct)
    -   Behavior:
        -   Can be added or removed.

4.  **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)**

    -   Represents the structure used to store and reference content.
    -   Attributes:
        -   Nodes (blocks of data)
        -   Links (edges between nodes)
    -   Behavior:
        -   Can traverse, link new nodes, or verify integrity.

* * * * *

### **Value Objects**

**Value Objects** are immutable and defined by their attributes rather than identity. They often provide clarity and precision within entities.

1.  **Content Identifier (CID)**

    -   A unique hash identifying the content.
    -   Attributes:
        -   Hash Algorithm (e.g., SHA-256)
        -   Version (v0, v1)
        -   Base Encoding (e.g., Base32, Base58)
    -   Behavior:
        -   Immutable and used to reference content.

2.  **Multiaddress**

    -   Encodes how to connect to a peer or a resource in the network.
    -   Attributes:
        -   Protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP)
        -   Address (IP or hostname)
    -   Behavior:
        -   Used for routing within the network.

3.  **Block**

    -   Represents a chunk of data in the IPFS DAG.
    -   Attributes:
        -   Raw Data
        -   Block Size
    -   Behavior:
        -   Immutable and used for assembling larger structures.

4.  **File Metadata**

    -   Represents information about a file.
    -   Attributes:
        -   Name
        -   MIME Type
        -   Size
    -   Behavior:
        -   Provides descriptive details about the file.

5.  **Routing Table Entry**

    -   Represents a connection to another peer.
    -   Attributes:
        -   Peer ID
        -   Latency
        -   Connection Status
    -   Behavior:
        -   Immutable and used for efficient peer lookup.

* * * * *

### **Example Relationships**

-   **Node** aggregates **Pins** and **Routing Table Entries**.
-   **File** aggregates **CIDs**, **Blocks**, and **File Metadata**.
-   **DAG** is composed of multiple **Blocks**.
-   **CID** is a Value Object used across entities like **File**, **DAG**, and **Pin**.

* * * * *

### Why These Designations?

-   **Entities**: Represent mutable, unique objects central to IPFS operations (e.g., Nodes, Files).
-   **Value Objects**: Capture immutable concepts that define system behavior and state (e.g., CID, Multiaddress).
